Project explorer 
Project focus on unification of data storage across different data acquisition systems (digital oscilloscopes, testing presses, acoustic emission systems etc.). The project explorer is designed to store data, order data, create multiple interpretation setups of data. Each user has access to shared interpretations or its personal interpretations. Each interpretation storeâ€™s its own post-processing steps, which originate from choosed data types at the data import phase. Post processing involve plotting, regression, feature extraction etc. The main goal is to reduce the dimensions of stored data and make them more understandable for humans and for finding new correlations between different parameters of stored data.

Current version is in the development. The main goal is to store data at faculty server.
