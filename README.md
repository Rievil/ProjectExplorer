Project explorer
Project focus on unification of data storage across different data acqusition systems (digital oscyloscopes, testing presses, acoustic emision systems etc.). The project explorer is designed to store data, order data, create multiple interpretation setups of data. Each user have access to shared interpretations or its personal interpretations. Each intepretation store its own post-processing steps, which originate from choosed data types at the data impot phase. Post processing involve ploting, regression, feature extraction etc. The main goal is to reduce the dimensions of stored data and make them more undesatndable for humans and for finding new correlations between different parameters of stored data. 

Current version is in the development. The main goal is to store data at faculty server.
